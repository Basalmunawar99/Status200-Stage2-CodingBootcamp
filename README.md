**Coding Bootcamp Projects**
Welcome to my coding portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects that I developed during my time at a coding bootcamp, where I learned the fundamentals of both front-end and back-end web development.

**About the Bootcamp**
I recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp designed to teach full-stack web development. Throughout the program, I gained hands-on experience working with various technologies, tools, and programming languages. I started as a complete beginner and grew significantly by applying new concepts to real-world projects.

**Projects Included**
This folder contains the projects I worked on as I progressed through the bootcamp. Each project helped me build a stronger foundation in web development, and they showcase the various stages of my growth. The projects range from basic front-end web pages to full-stack applications integrating both front-end and back-end components.

**Front-End Projects:**
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Basic web pages focusing on responsive design, styling, and interactive elements.
React.js: Single-page applications with dynamic user interfaces.
Back-End Projects:
Node.js: Server-side applications handling user requests, performing database operations, and managing APIs.
Express.js: Web applications using routing and middleware for streamlined server-side development.
MySQL/MongoDB: Database design, management, and interaction using SQL and NoSQL databases.
Skills and Technologies Learned:
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Frameworks: React.js, Node.js, Express.js
Databases: MySQL, MongoDB
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Postman, Axios
How to Navigate:
Each folder in this repository contains a specific project from the bootcamp, complete with its own README that outlines the purpose, functionality, and technologies used. Feel free to explore the code and see the progress Iâ€™ve made as I worked through these projects.

Conclusion:
These projects reflect my journey from a beginner to a more confident web developer. Each step in the bootcamp allowed me to challenge myself, learn new concepts, and apply them to meaningful projects. I am excited to continue building upon this foundation and exploring more advanced web development topics.

Thank you for checking out my work!
